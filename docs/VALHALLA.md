## SQLITE3

Dramatic but fitting as Odin gathered his fallen warriors there, in our regard gathering our data points. Wanted to continue this naming convention after greek / norse gods since Loki AI was so on point for that feature. While it also gives memorable names to features within this extension, as it is large while also 'seperating' features more to make them feel like they are there own extension / product or how ever you want to call it, since they are and that is how they are built into the extension. When you step back and look at it, all the features do look and feel like one extension, when in reality it really isn't. Take snippets for example, which hosts a feature parity that surpasses paid and enterprise products, yet it gets lost among the other features in this extension... Prometheus, giver of fire/knowledge to humanity. Snippets as "gifts of knowledge" to developers. Anyways...

for now i want to stick with norse and greek gods

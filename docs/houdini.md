>       Mark another WIN for microsoft, SCHWINGG... Who cares if one extension wants to progmatically disable / enable other extensions? If your that concerned in regards to your own extensions, code in a list you don't want to have modified by any other extension. YET, you let me disable ALL extensions with one command? But not indiviudally, no... because that would be malicious... The fuck are you guys smoking over there in those offices.

>       I'm not even trying to do anything malicious, INFACT this would help... literally every single vscode user... with saying that, I'm having to resort to... methods that the average dev wouldn't try.

>       We'll see how the tests goooo... but this will not be a feature you will be able to include in the your default layout, which is fine because from a use case perspective, you wouldn't need ( 95% of use cases anyways ) this functionality unless you were already in your workspace and switching from say front end dev layout to debugging or whatever.

>       Whenver you activate a new layout with this param, instead of resorting to vscode comamnds or settings.json files. It will instead run a power shell command calling a new vscode instance with the flags on enable and disabling extensions, because that I KNOW can be done, and then grabbing the current workspace root path, and using that as the folder path param to open vscode within an workspace, and ofcourse before it does any of that it first checks which vscode version you are running code vs code-insiders so the commmand will be something of the sort of `code-insiders --ext-enable ext1 ext2 --ext-disable ext3 ext4 /folder/to/workspace`, and I accidently trigger opening the wrong workspace... all the time progmatically since I have several workspaces set as item configs... so I know there won't be some sort of conflict, so lets yeet and find out

>       ... sigh. I'm running out of ideas and bugging ai's to help generate new ones, claude though... seems to think using the command auto enables all extensions except the ones you list in the command itself... I'll believe that when I see it. But a progress report, as of now no matter how I create the terminal, in all manners of trying to houdini my ass out of the vscode instance, nothing yet has worked, the closest I have gotten was executing the command via node, which got hung up on the very last second and was a tease because thats when it should have opened, but it did close the window... just not the instance as the node shell was attached to it and keeping it open. The next attempt I'm going to try write a ps1 script in the windows tmp folder, and executing it, then closing the vscode instance, meanwhile there is a small delay on the ps1 script... I have no idea what the result will be, but who knows maybe it will work, I have developed weirder solutions than this in the past. If it weren't for the huge upside in benefits, I wouldn't be working this hard to get this working.

>       As of now, this will be my last attempt till I revisit this in the future due to going past 4 hours on this one single thing. So unless there is an update below, this feature will not be active.
>
>       ... pffftttt, as fucking if... the last attempt worked, my confidence being so low in the probability of it working that I just threw the extension object in my default config... creating a loop of restarts so I'm just waiting for it to build as I edited another item... should have stated that this was my last attempt for the night hours ago. but I'm still moving on to fixing other things, and come back to this tomorrow, I'll be sure to leave this here, both for you to laugh at my misery and in hopes... maybe a microsoft employee will come by and read this and they can read about my latest houdini trick, escaping vscode from within. proving that no matter how they try to stop people, there is always going to be a way. when I put my self through 4 or 5 courses at offsec, one thing that became a glaring reality, and instilled the fear in me, if someone with just the right skill and drive / persistance, in the end... nothing stops them. the only good thing about that scenario, finding someone with that combo in tech, is soooo hard as they are very few and far between... so why bother putting these blocks up   ***SMOKE BOMB***

>       I will leave you with atleast one thing, as I was trying to escape vscode I was also working on the editor and terminal plexing, which has been just as much of a nightmare to get right... that too, the last attempt before moving onto something else, worked. Even though there are a couple of things to tighten in the engine, visualy anyways the layout is complete. So I'll leave a video here showing a workspace open and creating a 2x2 terminal group and a 3x2 editor group, toggling zen mode and then re-toggling all the items it disables leaving you off with layout I will probably never change from aside from the 2x2 and such that's just to show what its capable of, I apologize in advance for the weird screen sizing, but heres the [video](https://youtu.be/QGgaICeirqU)

> The final code:
> - escapes vscodes instance
> - creates a ps1 script in the windows tmp directory
> - and immediatly closes
> - meanwhile the script that was created, has a short delay to allow the instance to fully close
> - once the delay is up it then creates a new vscode instance with the set flags of what you would like to disable

> To put you at ease I will post below exactly what gets written to that tmp file for your review. I'll let microsoft know of the escaped terminal execution but when it comes to this software, I doubt they will do anything because of just how much you can do, in terms of command execution. The only reason I'm even going to bother telling them is because of the execution was done outside of the sandbox.-->
